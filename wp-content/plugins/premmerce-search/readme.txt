Premmerce Search makes the WooCommerce product search more flexible and efficient and gives the additional search results due to the spell correction.

== Description ==

Premmerce Search makes the WooCommerce product search more flexible and efficient and gives the additional search results due to the spell correction.

With the help of this plugin, the products search results within your store will be as relevant as possible for your potential customers. With our plugin, you no longer have to create the databases of synonyms and duplicate the words with common mistakes in the product name or its description.

For example, if your potential customer searches for “Aple” or “Appl”, instead of “No products found”, the plugin will show the Apple products in the results, if you have them in your store.
